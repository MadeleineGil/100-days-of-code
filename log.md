# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Monday April 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Followed next.js tutorial to create hello world site, running locally

**Thoughts:** Next.js looks like it'll be the best / fastest way to get a react site up and running.
So far am liking the simplicity and the things that the framework is handling for me (eg routing).

### Day 1: Tues April 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished initial nextjs intro, started experimenting with styled-components

**Thoughts**: I wanted to find a simple to implement UI lib, but finding one that plays nicely with next is harder than I thought. 

Settled on styled-components, not material ui for now.

<!-- ### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
