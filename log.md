# 100 Days Of Code - Log

**Today's Progress**: Followed next.js tutorial to create hello world site, running locally

**Thoughts:** Next.js looks like it'll be the best / fastest way to get a react site up and running.
So far am liking the simplicity and the things that the framework is handling for me (eg routing).
