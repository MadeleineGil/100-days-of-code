# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Monday April 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Followed next.js tutorial to create hello world site, running locally

**Thoughts:** Next.js looks like it'll be the best / fastest way to get a react site up and running.
So far am liking the simplicity and the things that the framework is handling for me (eg routing).

### Day 1: Tues April 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished initial nextjs intro, started experimenting with styled-components

**Thoughts**: I wanted to find a simple to implement UI lib, but finding one that plays nicely with next is harder than I thought. 

Settled on styled-components, not material ui for now.

### Day 2: Wed April 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Got styled-components working for me, Navigation and Footer UI started.

Next up, content and initial UI design for pages.

**Thoughts**: Finding styled-components is a nicer and more versatile way to add styling instead of jsx.

### Day 3: Thurs April 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Got some css working on the buttons and changed the content on the landing page.

**Thoughts**: Struggled with onclick and the way I want the work buttons to function.

### Day 4-6: Sunday April 12, 2020

**Progress**: Links in footer working, initial content json done.

### Day 7: Mon April 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Work history page content and icons now provided via json file.

### Day 8-10: Wed April 15, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Tues was a day off due to moving. 
Worked on work page icons and data displaying dynamically.
Index page flexbox with image.

**Thoughts**: Flexboxing what i could probably use a table for, but wanted to see how far I could take it. Might look into other solutions tomorrow.

### Day 11: Thurs April 16, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Undid the image thing I tried, re-aligned the work page.

**Thoughts**: Lack of motivation today. Need to look into what to use to do layouts before jumping in. Have been trying things jumping straight in and then giving up.

### Day 16: Tues April 121, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Got a proper background image working, tried to implement div blur. Did more UI thinking

**Thoughts**: I need to stop going back to design, or just hammer it out in one go. going back and forth is definitely not helping. But it's hard not to when I'm not familiar with the stack.

Need to focus on basic implementation and expand from there.

### Day 17: Wed April 22, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Added a headshot to index, added work content, changed pages, attempted sticky header and footer 

**Thoughts**: Felt a good flow of progress / things working today. Started to get frustrated by not getting sticky headings and footers. I've definitely gone overkill with the css, and there's double ups and redundant line, should clear that up, would help with the issues I'm running into with sticky.

<!-- ### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
